            <p>My husband liquidated all of our assets to purchase your entire stock. At first I was worried we would have no home, but the 
                Tactical Egg Holder makes a wonderful building material! Writing this from my beautiful acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
                double gallery porch.

            <p>This little guy really gets the job done, but it clashes with my highly curated late-1700s dandy wardrobe. Will not be using
                it in the future.

            <p>I fell into an interdimensional wormhole and landed on an unknown planet in a foreign star system.
                Thanks to this Tactical Egg Holster, I was able to raise two chickens and propagate them, giving me
                sustenance while I searched for help!
